    "The aim of this project is to investigate one aspect of music - music lyrics - and to analyse differences and commonalties between some of the most popular songs in recent years. In particular, I wish to examine differences in lyric style and sentiment between songs in different genres, while identifying the most common themes that have characterised our music in recent decades.\n",

    "This proposal is split into four sections:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li> Data collection: This section includes the identification of an appropriate dataset of song lyrics and collecting this data in a form which can be used for further processing and, ultimately, analysis. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Data Processing: Loading the dataset collected from the previous section using an appropriate data science library, ensuring its adequacy for the project, and rendering the data in a form that can be used for further natural language and possibly other forms of analysis. </li>\n",
    "    <li> Overall Analysis: Using the prepared and cleaned dataset, this section provides an overview of the whole dataset, focussing on analysis of commonly used words and themes.</li>\n",
    "    <li> Genre Analysis: In this section, the aim is to analyse songs classified into different genres and identify at a surface-level any commonalities and/or differences between genres, such as theme, use of certain words, sentiment, and song length. </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective behind this analysis is to provide an introductory background for further usage of the dataset. In particular, the dataset will be curated and analysed with the intention of extending the project in the future to build and train a genre classifier for unlabelled songs."

    "The 'Lyrics' column is the most important for this analysis, so it must be cleaned and prepped properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I extract the lyrics data into a list - this makes it easier to process and to obtain an initial overview. All lyrics are lower cased upon extraction - music lyrics are generally not case sensitive, and having only one single case to work with makes analysis easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "On initial observation, I can see that there are a number of issues which need to be sorted before proceeding with the analysis. These include:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Almost all lyrics contain contractions such as 'I'd' or 'can't'. This will impact the analysis since the alogrithm will read the contracted <i>'d</i> or <i>'t</i> as a seperate word, different from the original <i>would</i> or <i>not</i>. Hence, I will attempt to seperate as many contractions as possible and bring contracted words back to their original form.</li>\n",
    "    <li>There are a number of slang words. Although this may affect analysis, as for example the algorithm will read <i>gonna</i> as different from <i>going to</i>, one may argue that slang words are an important element in the identity of some genres, such as Rap. I can also notice that a number of words ending in -ing have the final <i>g</i> missing, such as <i>knowin</i> or <i>dancin</i>.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Spelling mistakes, typos, and extra characters. For example, typos such as <i>a.gain</i> or words which are are extended, such as <i>gooooooo</i>.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are a number of procedures that must be performed to prep the cleaned data for analysis:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Tokenisation - this treats each song as a 'bag of words', with each word analysed individually regardless of its position or context.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Removal of punctuation - I am interested in just the lyrics.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Lemmatization - words can come in many different forms. Lemmatization reduces each word to its base form, thereby allowing the algorithm to identify words with the same root. The cleaning process above will be vital for the lemmatization to work correctly.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

[verse 3: jay-z].  lights is blinding, girls need blinders.  so they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is.  lined with casualties, who sip to life casually.  then gradually become worse, don\\'t bite the apple eve.  caught up in the in-crowd, now you\\'re in style.  anna wintour gets cold, in vogue with your skin out.  city of sin, it\\'s a pity on the wind.  good girls gone bad, the city\\'s filled with them.  mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out.  everybody ride her, just like a bus route.  hail mary to the city, you\\'re a virgin.  and jesus can\\'t save you, life starts when the church end.  came here for school, graduated to the high life.  ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight.  mdma got you feelin\\' like a champion.  the city never sleeps, better slip you an ambien. . [chorus:]. . [bridge: alicia keys].  one hand in the air for the big city.  street lights, big dreams, all lookin\\' pretty.  no place in the world that could compare.  put your lighters in the air.  everybody say \"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\". . [chorus:]',\n",

    "However, interestingly the word 'love' does not appear in the top 10 frequent words for the Hip Hop/Rap genre. This genre also contains more taboo/swear words than other genres, with the worldcloud containing words such as 'fuck', 'shit', 'bitch', and 'nigga'."

    "The aim of this initial analysis was to provide an overview of the common themes behind the lyrics of the world's most popular songs, and also to understand differences between music genres in terms of lyrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The songs studied were generally classed as positive, with 'love' being the most popular theme. This is particularly so with the pop, rock, and R&B genres. Indeed, the analysis showed that there was no surface-level difference between these three genres in terms of lyrics. Lyrics are just one part of music - it could be the case that these genres differ on other musical aspects, such as melody or pitch. On the other hand, Hip Hop and Rap songs showed sometimes significant differences from other genres - they are longer, have a greater pool of distinct words, make greater use of slang and profane words, and are generally less positive in sentiment than other genres. Understanding these differences in more detail provides scope for further exploration of the dataset. Indeed, given such differences, it would be interested to test whether a trained classifier would be able to distinguish between rap songs and other genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before concluding, I would also like to point out some limitations and ethical considerations of this study. The study was conducted using a publicly available dataset of song lyrics from publicly available songs. It was intended as an exploratory investigation of some of the world's more popular songs and their themes, born out of natural curiosity. The study is not intended to pass judgement on any song or genre. All songs analysed are in the public domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The website from which the song lyrics were scraped is a social network-style site that allows users to post lyrics or corrections to lyrics. I am not aware of the review process that goes into these lyrics prior to their publication, and hence there is no guarantee that the lyrics used are 100% accurate. Furthermore, although I attempted to manually clean the most common contractions and slang words from the lyrics, I cannot gaurantee that all non-dictionary tokens were removed from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the dataset was scraped from lists of the Top 100 Songs per year. This could give rise to biases in the results, because ultimately there may be themes or styles that are generally more popular than others. Indeed, the overwhelming dominance of the 'love' theme over other themes could in part be a result of user bias - songs about love are generally more likely to be upvoted than songs about loss or war, and hence more likely to appear in a dataset of popular songs. An interesting extension to this study would be exanding the dataset with songs that are not necessarily the most popular, and examining whether a more diverse array of themes emerges.\n",
